    <p id="intro1">About Me, Stanley</p>
    <p class="intro2">What I was doing </p>
    <p class="mainbody"> After pre-college in Dublin, Ireland I came to the States for college. Since middle school, I love number and mathematics and, during college,
        I did like accounting class the most because I felt a great sense of satisfaction when I matched debit and credit balance in a blance sheet or income statement.
        After receiving B.S. Business Administration in Accounting from <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" style="color:#FFFFFF" target="_blank">University of Southern California </a>, I joined Deloitte as a real estate consultant.
        Me, as a consultant, I worked with seniors, managers and managing directors to find out the client's real estate investment opportunities, both for
        residential and commercial properties. Also, I was involved in financial analysis in private equity, banking and capital market sector.</p>

    <p class="intro2">Oxymoron</p>
    <p class="mainbody"> Although I love my team, the office culture and benefits that the company offered, in deep down, I always wanted to do something more creative, design-involved
    career. So, I fully re-evaluate myself in terms of what I truly wanted to be and what I am passionate about. After thorough research, I found out "product manager" would be the best
    fit for me because product management requires not only managemnt skill-sets, but also design sense as well as passion for new technology. While I was working at Deloitte, I did
    self-study for Python (mostly during late night) as well as GRE for further pursuing a master degree in computer science. Altough it is not a easy transition from business/accounting
    to computer science, but I believed that having experience in both consulting combined with trainings in CS would be uniqe asset to become a product manager.</p>

    <p class="intro2">Where I am </p>
    <p class="mainbody"> Currently, I am at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" style="color:#FFFFFF" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a> for M.S. in Computer Science with specialization in Mobile Computing. Since I do not have formal education
    in computer science and engineering backgrounds in university-level, everyday is challenging to me. However, I am truly happy at every moment because what I am doing is what I want to do.
    Especially, I enjoy coding where I can apply logical thinking and intuitive algorithms to solve complicated problems. Also, I love to talk about User Interface Design and Experience on how
    people react to technology. Furthermore, I absolutely love mobile development, specifically with Swift and iOS framework, building mobile application, because building an app is not just
    coding but a combination of design and technology that can be used in real life.</p>
